# Spring Boot :boot: REST

A quick start to building your REST API with Spring Boot and Spring MVC

From my Udemy Course:  https://www.udemy.com/course/restful-web-services-with-spring-framework-a-quick-start/learn/lecture/11769890#overview

Course is fine as a reminder, however there is little explanation of what is happening, there are no student exercises and no pdf or resources to download.
It was free, so no complaints there.
The author does have a useful source of resources, such as cheat sheets on http://appsdeveloperblog.com/
Also see https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-defineconstraints-spec for a list of available bean validation constraints, e.g. @Email

# MVC
## Controller
There is a Controller class for the REST endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
## Model
There is a RequestModel class for the incoming requests which handles the validation.

There is a ResponseModel class for the persisted entity
